## planar-robots-configuration-space-and-motion-planning-matlab
This GitHub repository contains a MATLAB code implementation for simulating the collision avoidance of two square robots, labeled A and B, operating in a 2-D workspace. The robots are constrained to move along fixed tracks, represented by solid gray lines, without rotation.


The code utilizes a 2-D configuration space to represent the system. The axes of the configuration space correspond to the positions of the two robots in the workspace. The X-axis represents the horizontal position of robot A, and the Y-axis represents the vertical position of robot B. The limits of the configuration space are determined by the boundaries of the workspace.


The included diagram in the repository depicts the initial configuration of the robots in the workspace. Each tick on the diagram represents a unit distance.

The MATLAB code can be used to simulate and analyze different scenarios of robot motion, allowing users to explore various strategies for collision avoidance in a 2-D environment:
